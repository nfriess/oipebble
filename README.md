# OpenIntents apps for Pebble watch

This project contains Pebble watch apps that interface with the
popular [OpenIntents](http://www.openintents.org/) Android apps.

Instead of creating new apps for the Pebble watch from scratch,
I wanted to be able utilize the existing Android apps and instead
make the Pebble simply interface with the underlying data that
the OI apps make available.

## Projects

- **OIPebbleAndroid**: An adapter app for Android that listens
  for messages from the Pebble apps and interfaces with the OI
  Android apps.
- **oiNotepadPebble**: The OI Notepad app that runs
  on a Pebble watch.
- **oiShoppingPebble**: The OI Shopping List app that runs
  on a Pebble watch.
